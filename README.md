**Systems Security Engineer in Training | OS & AI-Driven Defense Architect**

> Building living systems — where software can see, think, and defend itself.

---

##  Core Focus
- OS & Kernel Security  
- Malware & Reverse Engineering  
- AI-Driven Threat Detection  
- System Telemetry & Behavior Analysis  

I don’t build apps.  
I build **systems that understand themselves**.

---

##  Primary Weapon
**C++ (Systems & Performance-Focused)**  
Used for low-level telemetry, cross-platform tooling, and security-critical logic.

Supporting tools:  
Python • Java • Linux • Git • Web Stack

##  ARC OS – My Long-Term Project
A modular, AI-assisted operating system built around **self-awareness and defense**.

ARC OS is powered by two core subsystems:

###  **SIT – System Insight Toolkit**
A cross-platform system telemetry engine  
- CPU, memory, process & health monitoring  
- Windows + Linux via conditional compilation  
- Also available as a C/C++ library for deep system integration  

> The **nervous system** of ARC OS.

---

###  **Aurora – Active System Defense Engine**
A real-time process & behavior monitoring engine  
- Tracks system activity and anomalies  
- Designed for AI-driven adaptation  
- Will detect abnormal or malicious behavior over time  

> The **immune system** of ARC OS.

##  Featured Projects

### **WMS-X — Enterprise-Grade Warehouse System**
A modular, object-oriented warehouse management system built in C++  
- JSON-based persistent storage  
- Transaction-level receipt system  
- Clean CLI interface  
- Designed for future Web & company-scale deployment  

> Proof of **software architecture**, not just code.

---

### **SIT — System Insight Toolkit**
Low-level system telemetry & health monitoring tool  
- Cross-platform (Windows + Linux)  
- C++ CLI + C/C++ Library  
- Built for OS-level integration  

---

### **Aurora — Active System Monitor**
A behavior-based detection engine  
- Monitors all processes & system usage  
- Designed to evolve with AI  
- Will become the defensive core of ARC OS

##  Tech Stack
C++ • Linux • Git • Python • Java • JSON • Web Stack

##  Philosophy
> “A secure system is not one that hides.  
> It is one that **understands**.”

I am building the future of **self-aware, self-defending systems**.
