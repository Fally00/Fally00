Hello, I’m Fally (Rayan)

A builder at heart — I experiment, break things, rebuild them better, and keep pushing forward.
I’m currently diving deeper into Cybersecurity, AI-assisted systems, and the architecture behind intelligent automation.

 What drives me

Creating tools that think and adapt

AI assistant development + autonomous workflows

Reverse-engineering, experimenting, understanding why things work

Turning ambitious ideas into real projects, one step at a time

 Learning & working on

Cybersecurity fundamentals + offensive/defensive concepts

C++ / Python development

AI-powered automation + knowledge-based systems

Building projects bigger than my current skill level — intentionally

 A bit more about me

I like systems that grow over time, learn, evolve

I break things for knowledge, not chaos

Music balances my world — concept, emotion, structure
