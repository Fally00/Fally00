Cybersecurity student with a focus on system understanding, AI automation, and scalable project logic. Interested in assistant-style AI, self-learning systems, reverse engineering, and software that adapts over time. I observe ,experiment, break, analyze, and rebuild to understand how systems function at their core.

Currently working with C++ , Java and Python, improving architecture skills through practical projects, and exploring cyber defense/offense principles. Interested in building larger infrastructure-driven ideas with progressive iteration.
